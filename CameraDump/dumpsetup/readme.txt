Game Boy Camera Dump is made for use with
a cart reader and the Game Boy Camera. By
using a cart reader to capture the save
ram inside the Game Boy Camera, you can use
this program to display and save those pictures
to BMP format for display on your web page, driver's
license, kitchen wallpaper, etc.

Note that if you do not have access to a 
cart reader, this program will be pretty useless.
Please do not email me asking how to get a cart reader,
mine just mysteriously appeared at my doorstep
one day!

If you have any questions, comments, bug reports,
noodle recipes or huge amounts of US currency that
you want to give away, please email me at
rbaffy@geneticfantasia.com

Test pictures provided by Jeff F. exept game face,
provided by Billy Boy.

Thanks go out to Jeff Frohwein, Mr. Mika, and
all the homebrew GB developers out there. You make
my nipples tingle.

[Update 2014 -- Wow. Was I ever that young and foolish?
Answer: Yes. You can now reach me at rbaffy@gmail.com,
though I'm no longer updating this program.]
